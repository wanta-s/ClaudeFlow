The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.1] - 2025-01-10

### Restored
- Hybrid implementation mode (combining Context Engineering and Incremental approaches)
- Implementation mode selection in run-pipeline.sh (4 options)
- `hybrid-implementation.sh` script with quality validation
- `incremental-implementation.sh` script
- `HYBRID-IMPLEMENTATION.md` documentation
- `06_implementation_incremental.md` task file

### Changed
- run-pipeline.sh now offers 4 implementation modes again:
  1. Context Engineering
  2. Incremental
  3. Hybrid (recommended)
  4. Standard

## [2.6.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added
- External prompt files in `prompts/` directory for better maintainability
- Common functions library (`common-functions.sh`) with prompt loading utilities
- `load_prompt` and `apply_prompt_vars` functions for dynamic prompt management

### Changed
- Simplified implementation phase to use only Context Engineering mode
- Removed implementation mode selection from run-pipeline.sh
- All prompts are now stored in separate MD files for easier version control

### Removed
- Incremental implementation mode and related scripts
- Hybrid implementation mode and documentation
- Implementation mode selection during phase 6
- Files removed: `incremental-implementation.sh`, `hybrid-implementation.sh`, `HYBRID-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## [2.5.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added
- Quality Validation Research phase after minimal implementation
- Automatic code quality analysis for reliability, maintainability, and reusability
- Iterative improvement process (up to 3 iterations) until quality standards are met
- Quality scoring system (5-point scale, must achieve 3+ on all items, 4+ average)
- Research results saved to context for future reference

### Changed
- Hybrid implementation now has 9 steps instead of 8
- Updated all documentation to reflect the new quality validation phase
- Improved code quality through systematic validation before testing

## [2.4.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added
- New Hybrid Implementation mode combining Context Engineering and Incremental approaches
- Created hybrid-implementation.sh script with 8-step process per feature
- Comprehensive HYBRID-IMPLEMENTATION.md documentation
- Pattern library mechanism that grows with each implemented feature
- Code metrics tracking for quality assurance
- Immediate testing after minimal implementation for early failure detection

### Changed
- Updated DEVELOPMENT-FLOW.md to include 4 implementation modes (added Hybrid)
- Modified USAGE-JP.md to recommend Hybrid implementation for new projects
- Hybrid mode is now the recommended default approach
