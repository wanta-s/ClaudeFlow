Looking at your request, I need to see the code you want me to refactor. Could you please provide the code that needs refactoring?

Once you share the code, I'll:
1. Analyze it for reliability, maintainability, and reusability improvements
2. Apply the existing patterns from your library
3. Focus on code simplicity and performance optimization
4. Enhance it to meet the quality standards (5/5) you've outlined

Please paste the code you'd like me to refactor.
