I'll help you refactor the code. However, I notice that the actual code to be refactored wasn't included in your message. You've provided the improved code, existing patterns, and quality evaluation results, but not the original code that needs refactoring.

Could you please provide the original code that you'd like me to refactor? Once you share it, I'll apply the improvements focusing on:
- Code conciseness
- Performance optimization
- Utilizing existing patterns from your pattern library
