I'll help you test the implementation and check for any issues. However, I don't see any implementation content provided in your message. Could you please share the HTML/JavaScript code or files you'd like me to test?

Once you provide the implementation, I'll check for:
- HTML syntax errors
- JavaScript functionality
- Main feature operations
- Browser display compatibility

Please share the code or point me to the files you'd like tested.
