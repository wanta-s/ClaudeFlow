# Reservation Deletion Unit Tests

This document describes the unit tests created for the rough-level reservation deletion implementation.

## Test Structure

```
__tests__/
├── services/
│   └── reservationDeleteService.test.ts    # Unit tests for ReservationDeleteService
├── stores/
│   └── memoryStore.test.ts                 # Unit tests for MemoryStore
└── integration/
    └── reservationDelete.integration.test.ts # Integration tests for complete flows
```

## Test Files Created

### 1. MemoryStore Unit Tests (`__tests__/stores/memoryStore.test.ts`)

Tests the in-memory storage implementation:
- **findById**: Finding reservations by ID
- **update**: Updating reservation data
- **delete**: Deleting reservations
- **findByIds**: Batch retrieval of reservations
- **addReservation**: Adding new reservations

### 2. ReservationDeleteService Unit Tests (`__tests__/services/reservationDeleteService.test.ts`)

Tests the core deletion service functionality:
- **cancelReservation**: Soft delete (status change to 'cancelled')
- **deleteReservation**: Hard delete (complete removal)
- **bulkDeleteReservations**: Batch deletion operations
- **restoreReservation**: Restore cancelled reservations

### 3. Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/reservationDelete.integration.test.ts`)

Tests complete workflows and edge cases:
- **Complete lifecycle**: Create → Cancel → Restore → Delete flow
- **Bulk operations**: Mixed state reservations
- **Concurrent operations**: Parallel cancellations and deletions
- **Error recovery**: Partial failure handling
- **Business logic scenarios**: Future reservation checks
- **Data migration**: Handling legacy data formats

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all reservation deletion tests
./run-reservation-delete-tests.sh
```

### Manual Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx jest __tests__/services/reservationDeleteService.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npx jest --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npx jest --watch

# Run only reservation deletion tests
npx jest --testNamePattern="Reservation"
```

## Test Coverage

The tests aim for comprehensive coverage including:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Concurrent operations
- Data consistency

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Operations
- Single reservation cancellation
- Single reservation deletion
- Reservation restoration

### 2. Bulk Operations
- Batch deletion with mixed results
- Empty array handling
- Non-existent ID handling

### 3. State Transitions
- Active → Cancelled → Active
- Active → Deleted
- Cancelled → Restored

### 4. Error Handling
- Non-existent reservation operations
- Partial bulk operation failures
- Data consistency after errors

## Extending the Tests

To add new test cases:

1. **Unit Tests**: Add to the appropriate describe block in the existing test files
2. **Integration Tests**: Add new scenarios to test complex workflows
3. **New Features**: Create new test files following the existing pattern

## Best Practices

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Each test follows the AAA pattern
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly describe what they test
3. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and sets up its own data
4. **Coverage**: Tests cover both success and failure paths

## Future Improvements

Areas where tests could be expanded when the implementation evolves:
- Authentication/authorization checks
- Concurrency control and race conditions
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Database transaction rollback scenarios
- Event emission and notification testing
